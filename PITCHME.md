## Why PyTorch?
_Rajat V D_

This session provides a broad overview of how PyTorch is different, and why it might be a good idea to switch to it.

Use the very well written tutorial [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) for a detailed walkthrough of pytorch from scratch.

## Dynamic graphs

@ul

* Build the computation graph on the fly
* The graph is built every time you run the model/module
* Gradients are also calculated dynamically

## More pythonic you say?
It's an easy to answer to give when someone asks why pytorch - it's beautifully _pythonic_.

But what does that really mean?

Good python is:

* Simple code.
* Easy to read, and easy to understand.
* Does what you would expect, even if it's the first time you're seeing it.
* Easy to debug.

Let's see how these play out for pytorch
